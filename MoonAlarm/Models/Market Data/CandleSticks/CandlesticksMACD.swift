// Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that
// shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by
// subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA
// of the MACD, called the "signal line", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a
// trigger for buy and sell signals.
